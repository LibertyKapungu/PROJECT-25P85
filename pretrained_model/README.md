## Pretrained Models

This folder, `pretrained_models/`, contains pretrained ONNX models sourced from the [TinyDenoiser v2 repository](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/tiny_denoiser_v2). These models were developed by GreenWaves Technologies to demonstrate RNN-based speech enhancement optimized for deployment on the GAP9 MCU.

### Source Repository
Models and training methodology are detailed in the official GitHub repo:
