# PROJECT-25P85

This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on speech enhancement and noise reduction techniques. It includes implementations of various algorithms such as Wiener filtering, spectral subtraction, and deep learning models like GTCRN.

The project explores different approaches to improve speech intelligibility and quality in noisy environments, utilising both traditional signal processing methods and modern machine learning techniques.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed along with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MATLAB is also required for running the original implementations in the `loizou_matlab_code` directory.
